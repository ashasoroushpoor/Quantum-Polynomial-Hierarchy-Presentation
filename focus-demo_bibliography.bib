abstract="The notion of promise problems was introduced and initially studied by Even, Selman and Yacobi (Inform. and Control, Vol. 61, pages 159--173, 1984). In this article we survey some of the applications that this notion has found in the twenty years that elapsed. These include the notion of ``unique solutions'', the formulation of ``gap problems'' as capturing various approximation tasks, the identification of complete problems (especially for the class {\$}{\{}{\backslash}cal SZK{\}}{\$}), the indication of separations between certain computational resources, and the enabling of presentations that better distill the essence of various proofs.",
